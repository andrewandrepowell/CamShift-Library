CamShift-Library
================

The following files should be included with this readme:

	-CamShift Documentation.pdf 	a PDF file that contains the documentation for the CamShift class
	-CamShift Example Program.exe 	an executable built for a Window OS and runs the source code presented in Main.cpp
	-CamShift.cpp			A C++ source file that contains the implementation of the CamShift class
	-CamShift.h			A C++ header file that contains the declaration of the CamShift class
	-license.txt			A text file that contains the BSD licensing information for the OpenCV libraries
	-Main.cpp			A C++ source file that contains an example program that utilizes the CamShift class

The CamShift class is intended to provide a simpler approach to using OpenCV's operations for generating backprojected images 
and employing the CAMShift algorithm. The CamShift class was originally created as part of the Autonomous Lawnmower Project's
(ALP) localization system. More information on ALP can be found at www.powellsshowcase.bugs3.com.
